# Introduction

This book is for anyone looking to learn about push notifications on the web.

I started working on web push when Chrome first added support. There have been quite a few changes since then but the API's have stabilised across Chrome and Firefox so it's the perfect time for people to learn about push on the web.

This site / book covers everything I've learnt and will be updated with anything new I learn in the future.
